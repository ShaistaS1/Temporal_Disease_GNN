# 🧠 Temporal_Disease_GNN

**Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Predictive Disease Progression Modeling in Heterogeneous Clinical Data**

---

## 🚀 1. Core Objective

Develops an AI system that predicts:

- 🩺 **Future disease risks**
- 🕒 **Likely progression timelines**
- ⚠️ **Potential complications**

By analyzing **longitudinal Electronic Health Records (EHR)** using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**.

---

## 🔬 2. Key Innovations

- 🧩 **Novel Architecture**  
  Combines temporal GNNs (**TGAT / TGN**) with clinical pathway modeling.

- 🔄 **Dynamic Graph Construction**  
  Automatically converts EHRs into **temporal knowledge graphs**.

- 🧠 **Multi-modal Prediction**  
  Outputs both:
  - ✅ **Classification** (disease risk)
  - ⏳ **Regression** (onset timing)

---

## 🧪 Demonstration

When patients visit hospitals, their symptoms get recorded — but the underlying **connections often get missed**.  
This system transforms these isolated data points into **dynamic knowledge graphs** that reveal **hidden progression patterns**.

> 🧠 **Example:**  
> Recurring _fatigue_ combined with _high glucose_ predicts an **83% likelihood** of **diabetes onset within 2 years** —  
> enabling **preventive care** that existing systems would miss.
